## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Netlify Functions](https://netlify.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

## Payment Integration Setup

This website supports multiple payment methods through Stripe and PayPal:

### Supported Payment Methods

- **Credit/Debit Cards**: Visa, Mastercard, and other major cards
- **Google Pay**: Quick payment on Android devices

All payment methods feature official payment service logos for a clean interface. Payment methods are automatically detected based on device capabilities. Debug logging is only enabled in development mode for clean production logs.

### Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
VITE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup

1. Enable the following payment methods in your Stripe Dashboard:

   - Credit/Debit Cards
   - Google Pay

2. Configure your payment methods in the Stripe Dashboard under **Settings > Payment methods**

### Development Workflow

This project supports two development modes:

#### Frontend Development Only (Recommended for most work)

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Fast development server
- No backend functions
- Good for UI/UX development
- Runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- **Use this for most development work**

#### Full-Stack Development (For Payment Testing Only)

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

- Includes Netlify Functions (backend)
- Payment processing works
- Complete checkout flow testing
- Runs on `http://localhost:8888`
- **Use this only when testing payments**

**Note:** For testing payment integrations (Stripe, Google Pay, Mobile Pay, PayPal), use `npm run dev:full`. For all other development work, use `npm run dev`.

**Current Status:** The payment function is working correctly. You may see Edge Functions errors in the terminal, but these are harmless and don't affect your payment processing.

**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter MIME type errors with `npm run dev:full`, switch to `npm run dev` for frontend development and test payments separately.

### Netlify Functions

The payment processing is handled by Netlify Functions located in the `functions/` directory. Make sure to:

1. Set up your Stripe secret key in Netlify environment variables
2. Deploy the functions to Netlify
3. Test the payment flow in development using `npm run dev:full`

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Edge Functions errors in terminal:**

- These are harmless warnings and don't affect your payment function
- Your `create-payment-intent` function is working correctly
- You can safely ignore Edge Functions errors

**Netlify Functions not loading:**

- Make sure you're using `npm run dev:full` instead of `npm run dev`
- Check that your environment variables are set correctly
- Restart the development server if functions don't load

**Payment methods not showing:**

- Ensure payment methods are enabled in your Stripe Dashboard
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify Stripe publishable key is correct

**Payment processing fails:**

- Check Netlify Functions logs in the terminal
- Verify Stripe secret key is set correctly
- Test with Stripe test cards first

**Stripe payment method errors:**

- Make sure to enable payment methods in your Stripe Dashboard first
- Start with basic card payments before enabling Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.
- Test in Stripe test mode before going live

## Reflection

I chose to use Vite for this project due to its fast and lean build tool, allowing for a quicker development process. TypeScript was used to provide static type checking, and Tailwind CSS allowed me to style the website easily with low-level utility classes.

In the next phase of this project, i aim to introduce more interactive elements to the website and extend the support of more languages.
