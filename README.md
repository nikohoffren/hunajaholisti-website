## Reflection

I chose to use Vite for this project due to its fast and lean build tool, allowing for a quicker development process. TypeScript was used to provide static type checking, and Tailwind CSS allowed me to style the website easily with low-level utility classes.

In the next phase of this project, i aim to introduce more interactive elements to the website and extend the support of more languages.
